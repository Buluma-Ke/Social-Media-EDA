## What this is about

This is an exploratory data analysis on the world of social media, The data set contains 1000 entries with 6 columns;

| Column Name          | Description                                                               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User_ID              | Unique identifier that denotes the user                                   |
| App                  | Popular social media sites used on a daily basis                          |
| Daily_Minutes_Spent  | Time spent on the app per day (cumulatively)                              |
| Posts_Per_Day        | Number of posts uploaded each day                                         |
| Likes_Per_Day        | Number of likes acquired on posts each day                                |
| Follows_Per_Day      | Number of followers gained each day         

I used Python 3, Jupyter Notebook for its versatile data manipulation toolset that comes with it, Matplotlib and Seaborn came in handy for the visualisation, I have perticularly been attracted to seaborn because its creats a balance bewtween simple minimalsitic designs and aesthetically pleasing figures. 

however, I still think the dataset is too small to reach  a definate conclusion but its perfect for showcasing my Data Analysis skills, overall, it still paints a (faint) picture of the  the social media landscape that can be useful for small businesses trying to break out within the social media marketing arena. In the future I would get a more comprehensive dataset, big but managable that we will be able to compare the outcomes and maybe get a clearer picture of social media usage today.
